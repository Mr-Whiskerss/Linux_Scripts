Linux Scripts
Welcome to the Linux Scripts repository I have created over my time as a pen tester.
This is a collection of Bash scripts designed to automate common tasks encountered while working with Linux systems, particularly in penetration testing and system administration.

Feel free to clone, use, modify, and contribute to these scripts!

üìÇ Repository Contents

*Network_ConfigurationV3.sh*
Configure network settings easily with this script, including IP assignment and DNS setup. This is a great script for pen test exams or on site testing when you need to custom set your IP and DNS.

*Python_configurator.sh*
A script to set up a basic Python development environment on Linux, installing necessary tools and dependencies. This script will set up python 2 and 3 environments if that is something you need.

*build_script.sh*
Automates the installation of common tools and updates for a fresh Linux machine setup. My personal go to build script when working on fresh linux installs. 

*update_v2.0.sh*
A streamlined system update script for keeping your Linux environment up to date with the latest packages. A quick up date script for updating Debian based linux systems.
